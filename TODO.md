### TODO

---

- [ ] py_kanka_wrapper/kanka_wrapper.py - I don't believe I'm 100% coverage for the functionality in the wrapper to the api
	- [ ] Might want to write models for each of the response types to capture all returned data 
	- [ ] Review template manipulation I can use for both kanka and python
	- [ ] I can still add more plural methods for creation and deletion
	- [ ] Not sure how to use the kanka dice rolling functionality as that is what ttrpg core does and seemingly better
